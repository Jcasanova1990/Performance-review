analyzing past homework

FizzBuzz turned out fuctional- no need to configure.
print alphabet worked - but there is a method i could have use to remove number from the left side so that it would only print letters.
max char was confusing - something i still need work on.
finding anagrams i had no idea what was going on ill have to research this topic more for a better understanding.
char count wasnt so bad i just need more retention protocols "practice makes perfect".
rowReverse works but i know there are other methods.
